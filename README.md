1. **Clone the repository.**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jrp-dev/population-app.git
   ```

2. **Install the `http-server` package (one-time setup).**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory.**

   ```bash
   cd population-app
   ```

4. **Start the local server.**

   Run the following command in your terminal to start the server:

   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

   This will start a local server and serve the files in the current directory.

5. **Open the application in your web browser.**

   In your web browser, visit `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by the `http-server` output if different). You should see your application running!

**Note:** You can stop the server at any time by pressing `Ctrl+C` (or `Command+C` on macOS) in your terminal window.
